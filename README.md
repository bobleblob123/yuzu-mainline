yuzu is an experimental open-source emulator for the Nintendo Switch from the creators of [Citra](https://citra-emu.org/).

It is written in C++ with portability in mind, with builds actively* maintained for Windows and Linux. The emulator is capable of running several commercial games.

yuzu only emulates a subset of Switch hardware and therefore most commercial games **do not** run at full speed or are not fully functional.

Do you want to check which games are compatible and which ones are not? Please visit our                                                   [Compatibility page]  (https://web.archive.org/web/20240304185123/https://yuzu-emu.org/game/)!
